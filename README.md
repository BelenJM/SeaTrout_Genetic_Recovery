#### 'Genetic recovery of two wild seatrout populations following long-term stocking with non-native conspecifics' (Bekkevold et al., 2025)

Repository for the dataset and script on the study of the long-term effects of stocking in sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) in two rivers in Denmark.

### Methodology and scripts:
- Dataset:

  We used [this dataset]() for the analysis included in the paper

- Scripts:

  We used [this script](https://github.com/BelenJM/SeaTrout_Genetic_Recovery/blob/main/outlier_temporal_script.R) to run signasel on the dataset to look for changes in allele frequencies that can be explained by selection
