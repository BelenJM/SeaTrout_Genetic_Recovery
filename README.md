#### 'Genetic recovery of two wild seatrout populations following long-term stocking with non-native conspecifics' (Bekkevold et al., 2025)

Repository for the scripts on the study of the long-term effects of stocking in sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) in two rivers in Denmark.

### Methodology and scripts:
- Dataset used for the analysis:

  We used [this file](), consisting of X and X genotypes of X individuals, belonging to X.

- Population genetics:

  We used [this script]() to perform x, x and analysis.

- Selection tests:

  We used [this script]() to run signasel on the dataset to look for changes in allele frequencies that can be explained by selection.
